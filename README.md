## Getting started

Clone this repo and install the dependencies.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:cristianoliveira/snipgpt.git
cd snipgpt
npm i
```

Obtain your OpenAI key following these [instructions](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-secret-api-key).

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# edit the file with your key
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key" > .env
```

All good. Now run start it:

```bash
npm start
```

It will open a prompt where you can request for short snippets. It also works
for other stuff, for instance, to ask for examples of how to use a given
command from the coreutils.
